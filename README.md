## Data access
The data for this project includes Landsat data accessed through the [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2). The other datasets include fire perimeter data from [Fire permimeter data](https://hub.arcgis.com/maps/ad51845ea5fb4eb483bc2a7c38b2370c/about). In order to access the Landsat data, ensure your computer environment has netCDF4 or install with the following [documentation](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/#:~:text=Quick%20Install,HDF5%20or%20the%20PnetCDF%20library.). Socieoeconmic data includes the [Environmental Justice Index] (https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/eji/eji-data-download.html) dataset. To access this dataset, navigate to the website, choose '2024' as the year and 'geodatabase' as the data format. All data for this project was added to the .gitignore.
